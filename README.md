# infosec-sample-scenarios

- [x] lab-01 **Red** : Use NMAP to scan the DVWA 
- [ ] lab-02 **Red** : try and attack/fuzz the DVWA, Succeed 
- [ ] lab-03 **Blue** : Threat hunt the PCAP data 
- [ ] lab-04 **Blue** : Investigate how the traffic got through. 
- [ ] lab-05 **Blue** : Setup a firewall 
- [ ] lab-06 **Red** : Try and attack/fuzz the DVWA, fail  
- [ ] lab-07 **Red** : Use NMAP to try to scan again. (This should fail)
- [ ] lab-08 **Red** : Use NMAP to circumvent the firewall/IDS 
- [ ] lab-09 **Red** : Try and attack/fuzz the DVWA, Succeed 
- [ ] lab-10 **Blue** : Threat hunt the PCAP data 
- [ ] lab-11 **Blue** : Investigate how the traffic got through. 
- [ ] lab-12 **Blue** : Setup a firewall

## Scenario's
Scenario 1 - Create a lab that demonstrates the difference between nmap flags and when to use them.  
Scenario 2 - Create a lab that demonstrates IDS/IPS evasion techniques.  
Scenario 3 - Create a lab that has a user configure a firewall, demonstrate how traffic flows before and after setting up the firewall.  
Scenario 4 - Create a threat hunting lab using a .pcap file that illustrates malicious traffic on a computer.  
Scenario 5 - Demonstrate the power of burp suite on a buggy web application.
